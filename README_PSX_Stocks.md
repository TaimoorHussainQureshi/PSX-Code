# PSX Stocks Analysis Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to the analysis and prediction of Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) stocks. It utilizes various Python libraries for data handling, analysis, and machine learning to provide insightful visualizations and predictive models for stock prices.

## Key Features
- **Data Extraction**: Uses libraries to download and handle stock data from PSX.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Includes generating plots and charts to understand stock trends.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Employs machine learning models, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks), to predict future stock prices.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Numpy for numerical operations.
- Matplotlib for data visualization.
- Sklearn for data preprocessing and machine learning tasks.
- Keras/TensorFlow for building neural network models.

## Installation
To run this notebook, you'll need to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib sklearn keras tensorflow
# Add any other necessary package installations here
```

## Usage
